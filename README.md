SplitWise
A few friends decided to go on a trip together. They decided to log
their expenses and come back home and settle the difference.
Given an input of friends and amount spent, print out a list of who
needs pay who how much.
Assume every expense needs to be equally shared among
everybody.
You don’t need to minimise the number of payments that needs
to be done. Meaning, if A owes B Rs.100 and B owes C Rs. 100,
you don’t have to make A pay C this Rs. 100 directly.
Input
A, 100
B, 40
C, 100
D, 200
Output
A->D, 10
B->D, 70
C->D, 10
